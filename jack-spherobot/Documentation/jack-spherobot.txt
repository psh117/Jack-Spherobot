   - Motor1_Dir_A_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read 
                and returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property 
                for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].

   - CAN1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.
   - CAN1_SetRxBufferID -Sets the ID of the receive message buffer specified by the parameter BufferIdx.
   - CAN1_SendFrame -Sends a frame via the CAN device. This method allow to specify CAN buffer number, message ID, data to be 
                sent, frame type and whether the message will be sent after the request comes.
   - CAN1_ReadFrame -Reads a frame from the CAN device. The user is informed about CAN reception through OnFullRxBuffer event 
                or GetStateRX method.

Module "ASBluetooth" (component AsynchroSerial)
   - ASBluetooth_RecvChar -If any data is received, this method returns one character, otherwise it returns an error code (it 
                does not wait for data). This method is enabled only if the receiver property is enabled.  [Note:] Because the 
                preferred method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and 
                <OnBreak> the return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the 
                information about an exception in interrupt mode is returned only if there is a valid character ready to be 
                read.
   - ASBluetooth_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the component is temporarily disabled (Disable method) 
                SendChar method only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one 
                character can be stored. Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. 
                This method is available only if the transmitter property is enabled.

                not wait for data). This method is enabled only if the receiver property is enabled.  [Note:] Because the 
                preferred method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and 
                <OnBreak> the return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the 
                information about an exception in interrupt mode is returned only if there is a valid character ready to be 
                read.
   - ASDXL_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the component is temporarily disabled (Disable method) SendChar 
                method only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one character can be 
                stored. Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.
   - ASDXL_RecvBlock -If any data is received, this method returns the block of the data and its length (and incidental error), 
                otherwise it returns an error code (it does not wait for data).  This method is available only if non-zero 
                length of the input buffer is defined and the receiver property is enabled.  If less than requested number of 
                characters is received only the available data is copied from the receive buffer to the user specified 
                destination. The value ERR_EXEMPTY is returned and the value of variable pointed by the Rcv parameter is set to 
                the number of received characters.
   - ASDXL_SendBlock -Sends a block of characters to the channel.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the 
                output buffer is defined and the transmitter property is enabled.

                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.

                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc.   If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.    This method can be called only once. Before the second call of 
                Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - AD1_Enable -Enables ADC device. If possible, this method switches on A/D converter device, voltage reference, etc. This 
                method is intended to be used together with <Disable()> method to temporary switch On/Off the device after the 
                device is initialized. This method is required if the <Enabled in init. code> property is set to "no" value.
   - AD1_Disable -Disables the ADC device. If possible, this method switches off A/D converter device, voltage reference, etc. 
                (for example to avoid power consumption and possible interference). When the device is disabled, some component 
                methods should not be called. If so, error ERR_DISABLED is reported. This method is intended to be used 
                together with <Enable()> method to temporary switch On/Off the device after the device is initialized. This 
                method is not required. The <Deinit()> method can be used to switch off and uninstall the device.
   - AD1_StartSingleMeasurement -This method starts one measurement of the selected group of samples and exits immediately. 
                This is ADC SW trigger method. The group of samples for measurement is specified by preceding call to 
                <SelectSampleGroup()> or <CreateSampleGroup> method.     DMA disabled: The <OnMeasurementComplete() > event is 
                invoked after the measurement is done and if the event is enabled. Results of the measurement can be read by 
                the <GetMeasuredValues()> method.     DMA enabled: DMA request from configured ADC is enabled automatically. 
                The <OnMeasurementComplete() > event is invoked after the requested number of results are transferred to 
                destination buffer by DMA and if the event is enabled. <GetMeasuredValues()> method is not available if DMA 
                mode is enabled. If the DMA transfer was completed before and DMA is not recofingured, DMA error can occur. See 
                also <SetBuffer()> method.     The state of the measurement can be also polled by the 
                <GetMeasurementCompleteStatus()> method. The <Discontinuous mode> doesn't support this method.
   - AD1_StartLoopMeasurement -This method starts periodic measurement of the selected group of and exits immediately. This is 
                ADC SW trigger method. The group of samples for measurement is specified by preceding call to 
                <SelectSampleGroup()> or <CreateSampleGroup> method.     DMA disabled: The <OnMeasurementComplete()> event is 
                invoked after the each measurement is done and the event is enabled. Results of the measurement can be read by 
                the <GetMeasuredValues()> method.     DMA enabled: DMA request from configured ADC is enabled automatically. 
                The <OnMeasurementComplete() > event is invoked after the requested number of results are transferred to 
                destination buffer by DMA and the event is enabled. When DMA transfer is finished, DMA request is automatically 
                disabled by HW, but ADC loop mode is not stopped. In order to start new loop measurement with DMA, DMA must be 
                reconfigured by <SetBuffer()> method. <GetMeasuredValues()> method is not available if DMA mode is enabled.     
                The state of the measurement can be also polled by the <GetMeasurementCompleteStatus()> method. This method is 
                available only if HW supports loop measurement. The <Discontinuous mode> doesn't support this method.
   - AD1_GetMeasuredValues -This method copies results of the last measurement to the user supplied buffer. Data size depends 
                on the size of measured sample group (see <SelectSampleGroup()> or <CreateSampleGroup()> method). Data 
                representation is defined by the <Result type> property. Typically this method is called from 
                <OnMeasurementComplete> event to get results of the last measurement. This method is not available if DMA is 
                enabled.
   - AD1_CreateSampleGroup -This method prepares HW for next measurement according to array of samples defined during run-time. 
                The array of samples should be prepared prior to calling this method. Pointer to the array is passed into this 
                method in parameter SampleGroupPtr. The number of samples is defined by parameter SampleCount. Once any group 
                is prepared, the measurement can be started multiple times. Note: This method works only with the sample groups 
                defined during run-time. For design-time defined groups use <SelectSampleGroup()> method.
